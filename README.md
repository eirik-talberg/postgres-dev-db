# postgres-dev-db
A simple, insecure Docker image for local development in Postgres

## Why?
I got bored of doing it over and over again each time I was setting up a local database for development. 

## How?
This image initalises with an application database, user and password with full access. I use it for developing SpringBoot applications, I'm sure it can work fine for other things too.
